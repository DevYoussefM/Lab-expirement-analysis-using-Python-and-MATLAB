# Analysis of Laboratory Experiments using Python and MATLAB

This repository contains code implementations for numerical analysis and simulation of engineering laboratory experiments using **Python** and **MATLAB**. Key projects include:

- **Fluid Mechanics**: Calculating lift and drag forces for rough and smooth spheres, and for airfoils at varying angles of attack.  
- **Heat Transfer**: Solving conduction and convection problems using finite difference methods.  
- **Control Systems**: Simulating feedback loops and dynamic systems.

## Features
- Application of numerical methods such as:
  - Differential equation solvers
  - Equation solvers
  - Interpolation
  - Finite difference techniques
  - Curve fitting
- Clean, modular code for easy adaptation to other engineering problems.
